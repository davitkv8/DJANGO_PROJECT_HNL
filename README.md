# DJANGO_PROJECT_HNL  // on master branch



The project is of a demonstrative nature. I try to show you my web development skills (Back-end, using Django Async channels, djangoRF and etc..). Here, some of the samples used in Front-End are taken from "open source templates" and then edited by me.

!:

I used PostgreSQL database during the development. Do not forget to maintain your database in setting.py.

In the project file you will find "myEnvVal.py". Do not forget to indicate your postal information.

It is possible to encounter bugs. As I said, the project is only demonstrative and I will make some changes in it later.

Features (What I want to add to this project):

Add Django Payment method (Students will be able to leave feedback only if they've payed for minimum 2 lectures)
Add Video Chat APP with Django Agora. (To communicate teachers and students)
Make more code optimizations.
Preparing for deployment.
